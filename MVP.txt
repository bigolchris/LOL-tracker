Capstone MVP 

Project Name : LOL Tracker



- ive always liked the idea of being able to track game stats especially in games where looking over
previous games can help you improve in the next, like League of Legends. My app will let you look for any person 
that has a registered account in the game and get their stats from their last 5-7 games.
The app will let you compare stats to other players as well.
This will all be done using the League of Legends API.
